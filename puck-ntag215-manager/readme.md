# How to use

First, you'll need to upload [this .js file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swordstone86/omniibo/master/ntag215.js) (also shown in the text box below for convenience) to your Puck.js with the [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/).

Once your Puck.js is programmed, you'll be able to connect your **omniibo** to this app by clicking **Connect to omniibo**.

This, incidentally, also disables programming mode (UART) on your **omniibo**. If you ever want to put your **omniibo** back into programming mode (and make it accessible by the Espruino IDE again), you can click the **Enable UART** button that appears after connecting.
